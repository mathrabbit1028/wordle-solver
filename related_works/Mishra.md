1. always choosing maximal entropy query is optimal strategy (optimal query strategy in noiseless discrete channel)
- condition 1: the objective is minimizing error rate
- condition 2: the guess pool = the answer pool
- only proven by my heart (I recall that proof might be inferred from 'Cover & Thomas, Elements of Information Theory')
2. in this paper, only condition 1 is satisfied
- strategy 1: always choose maximal entropy query in G (guess pool)
- strategy 2: from query 3, choose maximal entropy query in A (answer pool)
- average guess: 2<1, however, 2 fails to find answer in 6 querys in some edge cases (JOLLY, HOLLY, FOLLY)
